# Unity 3D Web Experience Project

## Overview
This project was created as a comprehensive 3D web experience developed using Unity for a client working on a full-stack web solution. The primary goal of the project was to create an interactive and educational journey tailored specifically for Qatari government employees. The project comprises seven distinct scenes, each featuring hotspots that present questions and educational content to the user.

## Purpose and Target Audience
The main purpose of this project was to deliver an engaging, interactive learning tool for Qatari government employees, aimed at teaching and reinforcing knowledge through immersive 3D environments. The Unity component of the project serves as the front-end for the educational content, seamlessly integrating with a larger full-stack web solution.

## Key Features

### 1. Scene Navigation
- **Seven Unique Scenes**: The project includes seven scrollable scenes that users can navigate through. Each scene has been carefully designed to ensure smooth transitions and an intuitive user experience.
- **Scene Change Functions**: Functions were developed and exposed to the web for changing scenes on user interaction.

### 2. Interactive Hotspots
- **Educational Hotspots**: Each scene features multiple hotspots. When users interact with these hotspots, questions and educational content are displayed to facilitate learning.
- **Web Interaction**: Custom functions were created to allow the web interface to control interactions, including moving to specific hotspots and running certain visual events.

### 3. Data Handling
- **Data Integration**: The project ensures that all user data sent from the web application is properly stored and managed within the Unity environment.
- **Exposed Functions**: Functions were designed to expose specific Unity methods to the web, enabling seamless communication between the 3D experience and the full-stack web project.

### 4. Visual and Environmental Work
- **Lighting and Scene Refinement**: All lighting was meticulously designed and optimized for WebGL to ensure the scenes maintained their visual appeal while meeting performance requirements.
- **Modelling and Material Refinement**: I handled much of the modelling work, as well as the procurement and refinement of materials to optimize them for use in a WebGL environment.
- **Custom Shaders**: Custom shaders were written to enhance visual fidelity. This includes shaders for water effects and smooth scene transitions.

## Technical Details
- **Unity Version**: The project was developed using Unity, configured to build and run seamlessly in a WebGL environment.
- **WebGL Optimization**: Significant effort was put into refining assets and scene details to ensure they performed optimally without sacrificing visual quality.
- **Lighting**: Customized lighting setups were used to balance performance and aesthetics.
- **Shaders**: Custom-written shaders were used for special effects, including:
  - **Water Shader**: A dynamic shader for realistic water rendering.
  - **Scene Transition Shader**: A shader designed to create smooth transitions between scenes.
- **Data Parsing and Management**: Implemented robust systems for parsing incoming data from the web interface and ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval within Unity.
- **Camera Animation Integration**: Developed a system to work with client-provided camera animations in each scene, ensuring that hotspots aligned accurately with only animation clips as a reference.

## Contributions
This project involved multiple areas of work:
- **Integration of Web Functions**: Exposing Unity functions to the web, enabling control over scene navigation, hotspot interactions, and visual events.
- **Data Handling**: Ensuring seamless data storage and retrieval for web-sent data.
- **3D Modelling and Scene Setup**: Creating, procuring, and refining models and materials to optimize performance.
- **Lighting**: Designing and fine-tuning lighting setups suitable for WebGL.
- **Shader Development**: Writing shaders for special visual effects.
- **Camera Animation Alignment**: Implementing systems to work with client-provided camera animations and ensuring hotspots were correctly positioned within scenes.
